The whole project is done in C++. It is freely available on Github\footnote{https://github.com/yannramusat/Extractor}. Place your own datasets in a directory \textit{data} where you have installed the program. Use -h to get helped if needed. 

\section{Choices made}
\subsection{Part 4}

 To identify locations with a peak we use the following function:
\[
   \rho*coeff + coeff^2
\]
 where $\rho$ is the average number of peak per slot for the location and $coeff$ is an integer choosed by the user (default is $9$). 
 
 The first part is basically used to identify a peak and the quadratic part is to avoid locations with not enough tweets (for example if the average number of tweets per day for a location is less than one, $5$ tweets for a day could be considered as a peak).
 
 You can change the number of slot per day in order to be more precise in finding a peak by using the $-d$ option. Per default, the program uses day as frequence ($d=1$). 
 
 Experimentally (with $d=1$), it seems that $8-10$ is a really suitable range of values for $coeff$ to avoid finding other events than crisis. For value $9$ over the dataset \textit{marchCrisis} the algorithm identify locations (day): belgium (22), brussels (22), capitol (28), chicago (12), cyprus (29), istanbul (19), lahore (27 - 28), metro (22), nigeria (25), pakistan (27) and zaventem (22).
 
 You can easily verify that all of this peaks corresponds to real events that have been widely discussed in the press.
 
 For smaller values (like $5$) we detect much more events that we might not have heard from, like spain (25) with keywords "injured, killed, crash, students, bus" precisely explaining what happened. But we also have some false positives like the concert of Justin Bieber or the discourse of Barack Obama at Havana (Cuba).
 
 Choosing values of $coeff$ and the number of slots per day is a tradeoff between avoiding false positives and finding events not covered by mainstream medias.
 
\subsection{Part 5}

For each location with a peak we construct the co-occurence graph and apply the Densest Subgraph Algorithm we have seen in Lesson $2$. In fact, we apply a slight generalisation because we consider multigraphs (equivalent to weighted ones). This gives a $2$-approximate densest subgraph.

We then apply a simple heuristic keeping only the five keywords of maximum degree and return them.

Note that we filter the words whilst creating the co-occurence graph. The words belonging to the semantic vocabulary of meditation like "pray" or "thoughts" are ignored. Sometimes, this leads to less than $5$ words returned.

The complexity is linear but for some locations with lots of related tweets, for example $brussels$ in the dataset \textit{marchCrisis} there are $\sim 20K$ related tweets and a total edge weight of $\sim 388K$, so the mining can take up to $1$ minute to complete.

\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Precision}
\paragraph{Evaluation}
To evaluate the precision of the approach we'll refer to the following wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_d'attentats_meurtriers}} page and use the dataset \textit{marchCrisis}. 
With parameters $e=5$ and $d=1$ we found $9$ out of $10$ terrorist attacks repertoried for this month. Remark that we didn't found the attack in Iraq (29). This might be explained by the fact that each location is uniquely computed and it was the second attack for the month in the same country.

We highlight the keywords found for the attack in Iraq (26): "bomber, football, kids, died, attack". They give a precise insight of the event (cf wikipedia): "L'attentat du 25 mars 2016 à Al-Asriya en Irak désigne un attentat-suicide à la bombe s'étant déroulé lors d'un match de football de jeunes...".
